# Wetland Environment Zoonotic and AMR Assessment Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing environmental samples collected from wetlands along the East Atlantic Flyway. The pipeline processes Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to assess zoonotic potential and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns in wetland ecosystems.

## Project Scope
- Systematic analysis of environmental samples from diverse wetland sites
- Processing of multiple sample types including water, air, and avian fecal samples
- Integrated approach combining metagenomic profiling and AMR detection
- Comparative analysis of wetlands experiencing different levels of anthropogenic pressure

## Pipeline Components
- Read processing and quality control workflows
- High-resolution taxonomic classification
- Metagenomic assembly and functional analysis
- Comprehensive AMR gene detection and characterization
- Automated quality metrics generation and reporting

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- High-performance computing environment with multi-core processors
- Substantial storage capacity for sequencing data and reference databases (>1TB recommended)
- Minimum 32GB RAM (64GB+ recommended for optimal performance)
- SSD storage for database operations recommended

### Software Requirements
All required tools can be installed via conda:
```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n wetland_pipeline python=3.9
conda activate wetland_pipeline

# Install required bioinformatics tools
